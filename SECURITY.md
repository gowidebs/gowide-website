## Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

### Previous Issues (Fixed):
- **nth-check** - High severity: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
- **postcss** - Moderate severity: Line return parsing error  
- **svgo** - High severity: Multiple CSS-select vulnerabilities

### Remaining Issues (Development Only):
- **webpack-dev-server** - 2 moderate severity vulnerabilities
  - Only affects development environment
  - Does not impact production builds
  - Related to source code exposure in malicious websites

## Security Measures Implemented:

### 1. Package Overrides
```json
"overrides": {
  "nth-check": "^2.1.1",
  "postcss": "^8.4.31", 
  "webpack-dev-server": "^4.15.1",
  "svgo": "^3.0.0"
}
```

### 2. ESLint Security Rules
- No eval usage
- No implied eval
- Strict equality checks
- Console warnings for debugging

### 3. Build Security
- Source maps disabled in production
- Optimized builds with minification
- No sensitive data in client-side code

## Security Best Practices:

### Environment Variables
- All sensitive data stored in environment variables
- No API keys or secrets in source code
- Sanity client configured with public tokens only

### Content Security
- Sanity CMS handles content sanitization
- React's built-in XSS protection
- Styled-components CSS-in-JS prevents injection

### Network Security
- HTTPS enforced in production
- Vercel Analytics with privacy compliance
- No external script injections

## Recommendations:

1. **Regular Updates**: Run `npm audit` monthly
2. **Dependency Review**: Review new dependencies before installation
3. **Environment Separation**: Keep development and production environments separate
4. **Monitoring**: Use Vercel Analytics for security monitoring

## Status: âœ… SECURE
- Production build: **SAFE**
- No critical vulnerabilities
- Development vulnerabilities contained
- Security best practices implemented
